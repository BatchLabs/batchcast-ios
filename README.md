# Batchcast
This sample is a full fledged example meant to show both basic and advanced integrations of the Batch SDK with a real-world use case.  
Here, it is a podcast app that pushes new episodes notifications to its users.

For the moment, Batchcast is only a Swift 3 sample, but an Android version will come soon.
